      COMPILER										INTERPRETER
1.  It scans the whole program in one go.                              Translates program one statement at a time

2.  As it scans the code in one go,                                    Considering it scans code one line at a time,
    the errors are shown at the end together.			        errors are shown line by line.

3.  Main advantage of compilers is it's execution time.                Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object 
									code,it is preferred less.

4.  It converts the source code into object code.     		       It does not convert source code instead it scans it line by
                                                                        line.

5.  It does not require source code for later 			       It requires source code for later execution.
    execution.

6.  Error detection is difficult				       Error detection is easier comparatively.

7.  Pertaining programming languages are C,C++,C#,                     Pertaining programming languages are Python,PHP,Perl
    Java,Scala, etc.                                                     Ruby,etc.
